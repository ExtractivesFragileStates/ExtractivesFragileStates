        <p>The g7+ countries, a voluntary grouping of 18 fragile and conflict-affected states, boast some of the most abundant reserves of natural resources, which if managed strategically and sustainably have the potential to accelerate growth and development.</p>
	
		<p>Although many of the g7+ members are resource-rich, they face challenges to ensure that the exploitation of their natural resources results in multiple development benefits, including revenues, jobs and infrastructure. These include weak capacity to structure fiscal systems and manage revenues transparently; award licenses in competitive manner; prevent negative social and environmental impact; conduct compliance monitoring and enforcement.</p>
		
		<p>The g7+ countries in their Ministerial level retreat in November 2012 recognized that addressing the issues around natural resources was a major factor in the path towards resilience as nation states. The first step towards addressing the challenges identified in natural resource management is to have sufficient, reliable and accessible information on the location of extractive resources, the main concession boundaries and licensees, and production volumes. Capturing this information, the main objective of the Geo-mapping Natural Resources in Fragile and Conflict-affected States initiative, is seen therefore as a first step in helping the g7+ as a community understand their natural resource profile, how this has been changing over time; and understand how this interacts with other social, economic, and political conditions, including the interrelationships between natural resource management and conflicts. By so doing, they can begin to (identify) prioritize challenges and better understand trends; establish a dialogue amongst themselves, share experiences and seek common solutions.</p>
	
		<p>While significant quantities of information often exist on the extractive sector, this information exists in varied forms, and in some cases is not publicly available. The first step will be in understanding what exists and collating it centrally.</p>
		
		<p>It is for this reason that the World Bank's Global Center on Conflict, Security and Development has partnered with the g7+, the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), Belun, the Bonn International Center for Conversion (BICC), the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the International Peace Information Service (IPIS), and Revenue Watch Institute as a first step to produce a series of dynamic interactive maps on extractive and selected other natural resources (oil & gas, mining, and forestry & agricultural concessions) in all 18 g7+ member countries. The dynamic maps will help to visualize and provide an interactive spatial and temporal interface of information on extractive resources in each of the eighteen countries; industrial activity (including production levels) and industrial actors involved in these extractive resources; the changing policy, legal, economic and social-cultural set-up, including conflict events.</p>
